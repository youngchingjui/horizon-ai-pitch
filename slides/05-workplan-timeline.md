# Workplan & Timeline (12 weeks)

## Cadence

- Weekly: Mon planning (30m), Tue/Thu build, Fri demo (30–45m).
- Biweekly: Champion Clinic (90m), adoption/metrics review (30m).
- Monthly: Exec Readout (30m).

## Phase 1 – Discover & Baseline (Weeks 1–2)

- Intake workshops per function (60–90m each) to map top workflows and pain points.
- One 60‑minute interview per department lead (Sales, Marketing, CSM, Ops, Support) with Ching to walk through current processes, dependencies, and where AI could help; schedule at least 1 hour per department.
- Additional stakeholder interviews as needed (≥5 total) to document current ("as‑is") business flows; synthesize notes and opportunities.
- Instrument baselines: pull existing system metrics (funnel/CS/ops), capture current macros/templates, and define lightweight telemetry; optional pulse survey for perceived time saved. No stopwatch time studies (to reduce burden/cost).
- Select 10 pilot candidates through facilitated impact × feasibility prioritization (no formal scorecard deliverable).
- **Deliverable**: Pilot Backlog v1, Measurement Plan, AI Policy & Guardrails (2‑page).

## Phase 2 – Train & Prototype (Weeks 3–6)

- AI Core (2 x 90m) for all participants: prompt patterns, critique loops, verification, retrieval, and safe data use.
- Function Labs (2 x 60m) per team with hands‑on assets (templates, checklists).
- Build 10 pilots in 1‑week sprints (2 per function), with shadow runs in Weeks 4–5 and 3–5 going live by Week 6.
- **Deliverable**: Friday Demos (recorded) and working prototypes; notes and usage snapshots (no template library or pilot scorecards).

## Phase 3 – Deploy, Scale, Handoff (Weeks 7–12)

- Productionize best pilots (target 5–7), add monitoring and fallback SOPs.
- Expand to adjacent workflows; create Run Books and Champion Playbooks.
- Share weekly usage highlights and simple reports for shipped assets (no dashboards).
- **Deliverable**: AI Wins Digest (Weeks 8 & 12), Final Report, Roadmap for global rollout.

## Optional – Long‑term usage validation (+1w, +1m, +1q)

- Quick check‑ins after the 12‑week program: review usage reports and run a 2‑minute pulse survey.
- Run a "can we remove this tool?" litmus test with Champions; track objections as a success signal.
- Share a brief retention report and recommendations; trigger outcome‑tied bonus if sustained usage is confirmed.
