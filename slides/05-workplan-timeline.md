# Workplan & Timeline (12 weeks)

## Phase 1 – Discover & Baseline (Weeks 1–2)

• Intake workshops per function (60–90m each) to map top workflows and pain points.
• Instrument baselines: time studies on 2–3 workflows per function; export current funnel/CS metrics; capture macros/templates in use.
• Select 10 pilot candidates using an Impact × Feasibility scorecard.
• **Deliverable**: Pilot Backlog v1, Measurement Plan, AI Policy & Guardrails (2‑page).

## Phase 2 – Train & Prototype (Weeks 3–6)

• AI Core (2 x 90m) for all participants: prompt patterns, critique loops, verification, retrieval, and safe data use.
• Function Labs (2 x 60m) per team with hands‑on assets (templates, checklists).
• Build 10 pilots in 1‑week sprints (2 per function), with shadow runs in Weeks 4–5 and 3–5 going live by Week 6.
• **Deliverable**: Friday Demos (recorded), Template Library v1, Pilot scorecards.

## Phase 3 – Deploy, Scale, Handoff (Weeks 7–12)

• Productionize best pilots (target 5–7), add monitoring and fallback SOPs.
• Expand to adjacent workflows; create Run Books and Champion Playbooks.
• Build Adoption Dashboard (usage, time saved, quality scores).
• **Deliverable**: AI Wins Digest (Weeks 8 & 12), Final Report, Roadmap for global rollout.
