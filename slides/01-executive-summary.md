# Upskill Horizon Workforce with AI

We'll run a <span class="keyword highlight">12‑week</span> <span class="keyword">change‑management</span> program across Sales, Marketing, CSM, Operations, and Support for the Horizon team in China. The program combines short, high‑leverage <span class="keyword">training</span> with tightly scoped <span class="keyword">pilots</span>, measured against clear <span class="keyword">baseline metrics</span>. Every <span class="keyword">Friday</span> we demo what shipped. By <span class="keyword">Week 6</span> we will have at least <span class="keyword">5 productionized wins</span> and a public <span class="keyword">“AI Wins”</span> digest that can be shared with the global leadership team. By <span class="keyword">Week 12</span> we hand over <span class="keyword">playbooks</span>, a <span class="keyword">final report</span> and <span class="keyword">rollout roadmap</span>, and an internal <span class="keyword">“AI Champion”</span> network so China can scale independently and showcase wins to the global team.
