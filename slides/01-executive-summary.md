# Upskill Horizons Workforce with AI

We'll run a <span class="keyword highlight">12‑week</span> <span class="keyword">change‑management</span> program across Sales, Marketing, CSM, Operations, and Support for the Horizons team in China. The program combines short, high‑leverage <span class="keyword">training</span> with tightly scoped <span class="keyword">AI Workflow pilots</span>. Every other <span class="keyword">Friday</span> we review what shipped. By <span class="keyword">Week 5</span> we will have at least <span class="keyword">4 productionized AI Workflows</span> that can be shared with the global leadership team. By <span class="keyword">Week 12</span> we hand over all <span class="keyword">AI Workflows</span>, a <span class="keyword">final report</span> and will have conducted <span class="keyword">5x employee training sessions</span>, so the China team can scale independently and showcase wins to the global team.
