# Objectives

::default::

## Program objectives

- Help the China team use modern artificial intelligence tools with confidence in daily work.
- Run a focused 3‑month change management program across Sales, Marketing, Customer Success (CSM), Operations, and Support.
- Make everyday work faster and easier without lowering quality.
- Identify measurable use cases, pilot quickly, and prepare to scale globally after successful outcomes.

## Where we will focus

- Five business functions: Sales, Marketing, Customer success, Operations, and Support.
- For each function, pick a few high‑volume workflows to improve.
- Try specialized tools that support the work. Examples:
  - Sales: automate lead research, generate tailored outreach, and provide real‑time objection handling.
  - Marketing: streamline content creation, campaign personalization, and performance analytics.
  - Customer Success (CSM): enhance client insights, automate routine check‑ins, and surface relevant solutions based on account health.
  - Operations: improve process efficiency through workflow automation and AI‑driven forecasting.
  - Support: implement AI‑powered self‑service tools, ticket triage, and faster resolution suggestions.
- Build skills and change minds through short training, live demos, and office hours. Create a small group of internal champions to help others.

## What success looks like

- Pilot adoption and satisfaction are high; people choose to use the tools because they help.
- 1+ improved workflows per function become the new standard.
- Demonstrable efficiency and impact metrics per function, for example:
  - Sales: higher reply rates or meetings booked from AI‑assisted outreach.
  - Marketing: shorter content cycle times and better campaign performance.
  - CSM: improved client satisfaction scores or faster risk escalation.
  - Operations: reduced compliance risk or improved payroll accuracy.
  - Support: lower time‑to‑resolution or higher self‑service deflection.
- Clear, well‑documented case studies we can demo to the global leadership team to support rollout beyond China.
