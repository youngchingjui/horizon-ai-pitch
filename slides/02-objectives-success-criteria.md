## Program objectives

- Help the China team use modern artificial intelligence tools with confidence in daily work.

- Explore simple, safe tools that fit each team’s needs and ways of working.
- Start in China first, then share the strongest wins with the global team.

## Where we will focus

- Five business functions: Sales, Marketing, Customer success, Operations, and Support.
- For each function, pick a few high‑volume workflows to improve.
- Try specialized tools that support the work. Examples:
  - Legal: help with contract review and drafting.
  - Sales: improve outbound messages and follow‑ups.
  - Marketing: speed up content ideas and drafts.
  - Support: suggest faster, clearer responses.
  - Operations: automate repetitive steps with checks.
- Build skills and change minds through short training, live demos, and office hours. Create a small group of internal champions to help others.
