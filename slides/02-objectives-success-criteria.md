# Suggested objectives & success criteria

::default::

## Business objectives

- Aim for efficiency lift on high‑volume workflows per function (ballpark: 15–30% across 2–4 workflows; measured via existing KPIs and sampled output reviews—no stopwatch studies).
- Faster revenue motions: focus on pipeline velocity (e.g., +10–20% more qualified meetings/week per AE; +5–15% reply‑rate uplift on personalized outbound for Marketing/Sales).
- Customer outcomes: improve responsiveness and proactive touchpoints (e.g., −10–25% median first‑response time in Support; +5–15% increase in proactive health checks for CSM).
- Ops throughput: automate repetitive workflows with quality gates (target 2–4 workflows; shadow‑run accuracy ~90–97% before production).

## Adoption objectives

- Training completion: majority of target users complete "AI Core" and pass a short skills check (aim for ~70–90%).
- Community: establish AI Champions with office hours (target 3–6 Champions in China).
- Reusable assets: central library grows and integrates into existing tools (ballpark: 20–40 vetted prompts/templates and 8–12 SOPs).
- Sustained usage: validate post‑handoff with WAU targets at +1 month/+1 quarter (e.g., 20–40% at +1 mo; 30–60% at +1 qtr) and a clear "should we remove it?" no‑signal.

- Monthly "AI Wins" digest and a 30‑minute show‑and‑tell for the global LT (target timing: Week 6–8) highlighting China's results.
