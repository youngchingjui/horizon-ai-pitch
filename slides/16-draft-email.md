**Subject**: AI‑First China Lighthouse – 12‑Week Plan & Next Steps

---

Hi Amanda,

As discussed, I've outlined a 12‑week "AI‑First China Lighthouse" program covering Sales, Marketing, CSM, Operations, and Support. The focus is quick, measurable wins by Week 6 and a clean handover by Week 12 so China can scale independently—and you have a strong story for global rollout.

**Highlights:**
• 10 pilots, target 5–7 in production by Week 12
• Time‑savings and funnel/SLA metrics instrumented from Week 1
• Weekly Friday demos, biweekly Champion Clinics, monthly exec readouts (you as sponsor)
• Policy/guardrails and a central template library for safe, consistent use

I've attached three engagement options (Starter, Standard, Plus) with hours and deliverables. If you're aligned, I'll finalize the Week‑by‑Week schedule and we can kick off as soon as your Champions are named.

**To get started this week, could you:**

1. Name one AI Champion per function
2. Confirm tool access (CRM, ticketing, BI, KB; LLMs approved in China)
3. Share sample artifacts (emails, tickets, onboarding packs, QBRs)

Thanks!

Ching
