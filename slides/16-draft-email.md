**Subject**: AI‑First China Lighthouse – 12‑Week Plan & Next Steps

---

Hi all,

As discussed, I'm sponsoring a 12‑week "AI‑First China Lighthouse" program covering Sales, Marketing, CSM, Operations, and Support. The focus is quick, measurable wins by Week 6 and a clean handover by Week 12 so China can scale independently—and we have a strong story for global rollout.

**Highlights:**
• 10 pilots, target 5–7 in production by Week 12
• Time‑savings and funnel/SLA metrics instrumented from Week 1
• Weekly Friday demos, biweekly Champion Clinics, monthly exec readouts
• Policy/guardrails and a central template library for safe, consistent use

I've attached three engagement options (Starter, Standard, Plus) with hours and deliverables. If we're aligned, we'll finalize the Week‑by‑Week schedule and kick off as soon as Champions are named.

**To get started this week, could you:**

1. Name one AI Champion per function
2. Confirm tool access (CRM, ticketing, BI, KB; LLMs approved in China)
3. Share sample artifacts (emails, tickets, onboarding packs, QBRs)

Thanks!

[Executive Sponsor]
