## Audience‑led Workshops
_Content is shaped by real AI use cases and issues_

- 60‑minute informal sessions held after initial workflows go live.
- Bring your workflow or questions; we demo, review, and troubleshoot together.
- Focus areas: when/how to use, limits and guardrails, handoff points, safe usage, change requests.
- Outcomes: clarified usage, small improvements captured for backlog, updated FAQs.
- Cadence: bi‑weekly, 1 each department; recordings and notes shared.
- Intake: lightweight form to submit topics in advance; walk‑ins welcome.
