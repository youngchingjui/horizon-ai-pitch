# Training & Enablement (audience‑led, practical)

::default::

## Audience‑led Workflow Q&A Clinics

- 60‑minute informal sessions held after initial workflows go live.
- Bring your workflow or questions; we demo, review, and troubleshoot together.
- Focus areas: when/how to use, limits and guardrails, handoff points, safe usage, change requests.
- Outcomes: clarified usage, small improvements captured for backlog, updated FAQs.
- Cadence: weekly or bi‑weekly per department; recordings and notes shared.
- Intake: lightweight form to submit topics in advance; walk‑ins welcome.

_We intentionally skip pre‑canned technical lectures (e.g., prompt patterns, Retrieval 101); content is shaped by what teams are actually using._

## Examples we can cover live (by function)

- **Sales**: lead research copilot (one‑click country snapshot + decision maker bio), 3‑email personalization pack, objection‑handling guide with policy‑safe snippets.
- **Marketing**: content repurposer (webinar → blog → LI post → CN/EN variants), campaign UTM copy generator, SEO brief creator for "Hire in [Country]" pages.
- **CSM**: account health summarizer (usage + tickets + notes → next best action), renewal prep pack (QBR deck outline + risks callouts).
- **Operations**: document parser for onboarding packs (extract fields to CRM/ERP), exception triage assistant (flags anomalies), forecast explainer (BI → plain‑language insights).
- **Support**: triage router (intent + priority + suggested macro), answer quality checker (policy conformance), self‑serve FAQ generator from ticket clusters.

_(Each asset shipped as: a template + a "how to use" 1‑pager + short Loom. We evolve them based on workshop feedback.)_
