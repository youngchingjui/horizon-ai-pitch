# "Jagged" Intelligence

::default::

## What it means

- AI performance is uneven across tasks and phrasing — moments of “magic” and “faceplants.”
- The average improves with AI, but variance increases. Set expectations accordingly.

## Why it matters

- Choose work that maps to the peaks (ideation, drafting, summarizing, rewriting, translation, pattern‑finding).
- Add safeguards for the troughs (facts, compliance, novel reasoning, edge cases).
- Measure for sustained improvement, not one‑off demos.

## Team practices

- Start with a template, then iterate: show, don’t just tell.
- Verify: retrieval/citations or quick human review before sending externally.
- Escalate early: when it stalls, switch to narrower prompts or human fallback.
- Capture wins and fails weekly to sharpen prompts and playbooks.
