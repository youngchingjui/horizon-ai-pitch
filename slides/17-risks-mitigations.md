# Optional: risks & mitigations (for the appendix)

## Resistance or "not faster than doing it myself"

→ pick high‑volume, low‑ambiguity tasks first; show time studies; Friday demos.

## Hallucinations/compliance

→ retrieval from internal KB, no public data for red‑class content, human sign‑off on external comms.

## Tool access in China

→ maintain dual‑model strategy (China‑accessible LLM + global LLM where compliant); keep prompts/templates portable.
