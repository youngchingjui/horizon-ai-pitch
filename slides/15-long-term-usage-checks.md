# Long‑Term Usage Checks (opt‑in)

## Why

Sustained adoption matters more than short‑term speedups. We keep measurement light‑touch and focused on signals that are easy to capture.

## Scope

Check‑ins post‑handoff; review usage reports, run a 2‑minute pulse survey, and the "remove it?" signal test; provide a short retention brief with recommendations.

## What we check (+1w, +1m, +1q)

• Usage: WAU and events/user for shipped templates/agents by function.
• Quality: spot‑check rubric vs. Week‑12 baseline.
• Signal test: ask "can we remove this tool?" — track objections as success evidence.
• 2‑minute pulse: perceived time saved and confidence.

## How it works

• We enable light telemetry and simple usage snapshots during the 12‑week program.
• Post‑handoff, we run quick check‑ins and share a one‑page retention brief per window.
• Findings inform the rollout roadmap and playbook updates.

## Commercials

Flat add‑on ($3k–$7k) or outcome‑tied option: $30k for 12 weeks + $5k success bonus if sustained usage thresholds are met at the agreed check‑in(s).

## Client time ask (per week)

Function lead 1–2h, Champion 2–3h, ICs 30–60m, Project Lead 30m.
