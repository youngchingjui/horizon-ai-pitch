# Summary

- 12‑week change‑management program across Sales, Marketing, CSM, Operations, and Support for the Horizons team in China.
- The program combines short, high‑leverage training with tightly scoped AI Workflow pilots. Every other Friday we review what shipped.
- By <span class="keyword">Week 5</span>: at least <span class="keyword">4 productionized AI Workflows</span> that can be shared with the global leadership team; by <span class="keyword">Week 12</span>: handover of all <span class="keyword">AI Workflows</span>, a <span class="keyword">final report</span>, and <span class="keyword">5x employee training sessions</span> so the China team can scale independently and showcase wins to the global team.
- What we're trying to achieve: measurable adoption, faster cycle times, higher quality outputs, and a sustainable capability inside Horizons China.
- Ideal outcome after the program: teams continue shipping wins weekly, leaders see usage and impact in the metrics, and China is ready to scale practices to other regions.
