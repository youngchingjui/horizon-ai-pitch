# Change Management (ADKAR lens)

::default::

## What the ADKAR lens looks like

- Awareness — people understand why we’re changing now (business case, risks of status quo).
- Desire — people want to participate (clear WIIFM, visible quick wins, recognition).
- Knowledge — people know what to do (training, examples, job aids).
- Ability — people can do it in their real work (guided practice, coaching, SOPs).
- Reinforcement — change sticks (feedback loops, metrics, stories, incentives).

## How we drive it in this program

- Awareness: Program kickoff + Executive Summary set the case for change; guardrails keep it safe.
- Desire: Quick‑win pilots and weekly demos highlight value; celebrate contributions.
- Knowledge: AI Core + Function Labs deliver practical skills with 1‑pagers and Looms.
- Ability: Shadow runs, Clinics/office hours, and run books help teams perform on the job.
- Reinforcement: Wins Digest, simple usage snapshots, and Champion Playbooks sustain momentum.

- 07 Training & Enablement → Knowledge (AI Core, Function Labs, job aids)
- 08 Candidate Pilot Backlog → Desire via visible, valuable use cases
- 11 Communications (12‑week calendar) → Awareness, Reinforcement
- 13 Reporting & Deliverables → Reinforcement (usage highlights, playbooks)
- 15 Long‑Term Usage Checks (opt‑in) → Reinforcement (retention signals)
