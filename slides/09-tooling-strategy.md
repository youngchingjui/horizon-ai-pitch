# Tooling Strategy (vendor‑agnostic, China‑aware)

## Models

Support what China can access reliably (e.g., DeepSeek/Kimi/ERNIE) and GPT/Claude when compliant access exists.

## Where work happens

Inside existing tools (CRM, ticketing, BI) via native AI, APIs, or lightweight automations; avoid "yet another app."

## Integration options

Start no‑code (Zapier/Make/Power Automate) + retrieval over approved KB; graduate to light APIs if needed.

## Security

SSO, role‑based access, disabled training on customer data, logging for audits.
