# Reporting & Deliverables (you'll hand over)

::default::
## Deliverables

- Five (5) one‑hour stakeholder interviews to document current ("as‑is") business flows and pain points; synthesized notes shared with the team.
- Weekly report (Fridays): what we did, decisions made, blockers, next week plan, and simple usage highlights for active pilots.
- Three audience‑led workshops (co‑run): show‑and‑tell, Q&A, and co‑design sessions to improve change‑management outcomes.
- Usage updates: lightweight usage reports for shipped assets/pilots (no dashboards).
- Change‑management aids as helpful: brief comms drafts, FAQs, and a Champion Playbook/maintenance plan.

## Explicitly out of scope

- Template libraries or large prompt packs.
- Adoption or impact dashboards.
- Pilot scorecards; no stopwatch time studies.

## Handover

- Final summary report and a prioritized backlog for the next 90 days.
- If opted in: +1m and +1q follow‑up briefs with usage/quality retention and recommendations.
