# Reporting & Deliverables (you'll hand over)

## Deliverables

• Five (5) one‑hour stakeholder interviews to document current ("as‑is") business flows and pain points; synthesized notes shared with the team.
• Weekly report (Fridays): what we did, decisions made, blockers, next week plan, and simple usage highlights for active pilots.
• Three audience‑led workshops (co‑run): show‑and‑tell, Q&A, and co‑design sessions to improve change‑management outcomes.
• Usage updates: lightweight usage reports for shipped assets/pilots (no dashboards).
• Change‑management aids as helpful: brief comms drafts, FAQs, and a Champion Playbook/maintenance plan.

## Explicitly out of scope

• Template libraries or large prompt packs.
• Adoption or impact dashboards.
• Pilot scorecards; no stopwatch time studies.

## Handover

• Final summary report and a prioritized backlog for the next 90 days.
• If opted in: +1m and +1q follow‑up briefs with usage/quality retention and recommendations.
