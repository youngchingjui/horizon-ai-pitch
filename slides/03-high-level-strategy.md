# We will co-build customized AI workflows for each function  

::default::
We will introduce practical AI into five functions — Sales, Marketing, CSM, Operations, and Support — to improve day‑to‑day workflows. The approach is simple: co‑design a few high‑impact use cases per team, teach the skills to use them well, ship fast, and measure what sticks.

::right::
## Program flow
- Work with designated "AI Champion" from each department to surface top workflows and pain points.
- Co‑design and prioritize 10 candidate use cases (impact × feasibility).
- Build quick pilots, validate and revise, then take live with wider team.
- Train and enable: Train AI Champions + wider team to use AI.
- Change management: clear comms, guardrails, clinics/office hours, recognition.

# How we'll achieve the objectives (grid view)

- Partner with 5 departments to surface top workflows and pain points.
- Co‑design and prioritize 10 candidate use cases (impact × feasibility).
- Build quick pilots, run in shadow mode, then take 5–7 live with quality gates.
- Train and enable: AI Core for everyone + Function Labs per team; stand up AI Champions.
- Change management: clear comms, guardrails, clinics/office hours, recognition.
- Measure and iterate: simple weekly usage snapshots, quality sampling, funnel/support deltas, and the "can we remove it?" signal test.
- Handoff: run books, playbooks, and a 90‑day backlog to scale wins.

## How

- **5x 2-week Build Sprints** across **Sales**, **Marketing**, **Customer success**, **Operations**, and **Support**.
- For each function, pick **2+ high‑volume workflows** to improve.
- Build pilot AI workflows using off-the-shelf tools.
- Build skills and change minds through short training, live demos, and office hours. Create a small group of internal champions to help others.
