# The Plan: With each function, we will engage, co-build customized AI workflows, and train employees 

::default::
We will introduce practical AI into five functions — **Sales, Marketing, CSM, Operations**, and **Support** — to improve day‑to‑day workflows. The approach is simple: co‑design a few high‑impact use cases per team, teach the skills to use them well, ship fast, and measure what sticks.

::right::
- Pick **2+ high‑volume workflows** to explore and improve for each function.
- Design and build an optimized **AI workflow pilot** for each identified workflow (up to 10 pilots).
- Use available **off‑the‑shelf tools** to avoid long build-times.
- **Audience-led workshops** to showcase and address common concerns with AI workflows.
- Build skills and change minds through **short training sessions, live demos, and office hours**.
