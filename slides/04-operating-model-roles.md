# Operating Model & Required Resources

## Required resources

- AI Consultant: Ching — designs curriculum, runs discovery, builds pilots, defines metrics, and hosts Friday demos.
- Functional Leads — one per department (Sales, Marketing, CSM, Ops, Support) serving as AI Champions; provide processes, sample data, and sign‑off, and commit to a 60‑minute discovery interview with Ching in Weeks 1–2.
- IT / Data / Legal — provision tools and access (SSO), review data policy and retention, ensure compliance.
- Tool evaluation budget — allocate approximately $500 USD (≈¥3,500 RMB) for 1–2 months of trials across 10+ off‑the‑shelf SaaS tools (most ≈$20/month) so we can subscribe, test, and compare during pilots.
