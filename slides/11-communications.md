Notes
- Weekly report from Qing every Friday: progress, wins, risks, next week focus; share recordings or GIFs where helpful.
- End‑of‑month (EOM) executive updates in Weeks 4, 8, and 12 for a wider audience; align on decisions, unblockers, and next phase.
- Interspersed 1:1s with department heads and AI champions to capture feedback, spot adoption risks, and tune pilots.
