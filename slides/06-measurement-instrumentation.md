# Measurement

::default::

## How we will measure (kept simple)

- Signal test: We will announce in advance that access to a tool will be temporarily turned off at a set time. If people ask for access to be restored, that is a strong positive signal that the tool is useful.
- Usage inside the tool: We will review each toolâ€™s dashboard or application programming interface for basic usage. Examples include number of runs, number of workflows used, number of active users, tokens consumed (when available), and simple trends over time.

No complex frameworks or jargon. Acronyms are spelled out.

## Weekly update (every Friday)

- A short note for each tool with:
  - Usage snapshot and trend
  - Any requests to restore access from the signal test
  - Highlights and changes shipped
  - Issues or blockers and any asks
- At month end, a simple summary across tools highlighting progress and usage signals.
