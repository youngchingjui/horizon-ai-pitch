# Measurement & Instrumentation

## How we measure

• **Time saved**: before/after stopwatch on standard tasks (n≥10 samples/workflow).
• **Quality**: manager review rubric (e.g., accuracy, tone, completeness).
• **Funnel**: CRM fields (reply rate, meetings booked, cycle time).
• **Support**: AHT, FRT, deflection %, reopen rate.
• **Adoption**: weekly active users of templates/agents, prompts per user, completion of AI Core.

## Dashboards

• Function KPIs (tiles) + "time saved equivalent FTE" + adoption line chart + list of shipped assets.
• A weekly Top 5 Wins tile (with short Loom clips) for Amanda's updates.
