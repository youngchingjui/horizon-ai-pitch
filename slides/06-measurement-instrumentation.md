# Measures for success

::default::

## How we measure

- **Sustained adoption**: weekly active users of templates/agents at +1 week, +1 month, +1 quarter; events per user; completion of AI Core.
- **Quality**: manager review rubric (e.g., accuracy, tone, completeness) on sampled outputs.
- **Funnel**: CRM fields (reply rate, meetings booked, cycle time) where applicable.
- **Support**: AHT, FRT, deflection %, reopen rate.
- **Signal test**: "Can we remove this tool?" litmus with Champions; objections logged as success signal.
- **Optional**: 2‑minute pulse survey on perceived time saved and confidence (no stopwatch studies).
