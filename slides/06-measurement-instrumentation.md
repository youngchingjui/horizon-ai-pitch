# Measurement & Instrumentation

## How we measure (low‑overhead)

• **Sustained adoption**: weekly active users of templates/agents at +1 week, +1 month, +1 quarter; events per user; completion of AI Core.
• **Quality**: manager review rubric (e.g., accuracy, tone, completeness) on sampled outputs.
• **Funnel**: CRM fields (reply rate, meetings booked, cycle time) where applicable.
• **Support**: AHT, FRT, deflection %, reopen rate.
• **Signal test**: "Can we remove this tool?" litmus with Champions; objections logged as success signal.
• **Optional**: 2‑minute pulse survey on perceived time saved and confidence (no stopwatch studies).

## Weekly usage report (Fridays)

• **Summary**: what we did this week; shipped improvements and experiments.
• **Usage metrics**: WAU, events per user, +1w/+1m retention, quality sampling scores, funnel/support deltas.
• **Highlights**: Top 5 wins with links or short clips.
• **Blockers & risks**: issues observed and asks for help.
• **Next week**: priorities and planned ships.
• **Cumulative impact**: running totals and open actions.
