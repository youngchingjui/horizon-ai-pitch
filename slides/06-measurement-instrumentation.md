# Measurement & Instrumentation

## How we measure (low‑overhead)

• **Sustained adoption**: weekly active users of templates/agents at +1 week, +1 month, +1 quarter; events per user; completion of AI Core.
• **Quality**: manager review rubric (e.g., accuracy, tone, completeness) on sampled outputs.
• **Funnel**: CRM fields (reply rate, meetings booked, cycle time) where applicable.
• **Support**: AHT, FRT, deflection %, reopen rate.
• **Signal test**: "Can we remove this tool?" litmus with Champions; objections logged as success signal.
• **Optional**: 2‑minute pulse survey on perceived time saved and confidence (no stopwatch studies).

## Reporting (not dashboards)

• Weekly project report with wins, blockers, decisions, and next week plan.
• Simple usage snapshot for active pilots: WAU, events/user, and notable adoption signals.
• End‑of‑month executive brief highlighting progress and usage signals.
• No dashboards; focus on concise, decision‑ready updates.
